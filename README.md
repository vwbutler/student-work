# Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio "Meet Virginia" 

## Description

This project showcases my skills and talents by highlighting my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. By creating the portfolio, I applied new skills I've recently learned such as flexbox and CSS variables.

The portfolio is designed for a typical hiring manager to assess my potential for an open position.

## Deployment

[Visit my profile on Github](https://vwbutler.github.io/student-work/)

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    * WHEN I load their portfolio
        * THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    * WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
        * THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    * WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
        * THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    * WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
        *THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    * WHEN I click on the images of the applications
        * THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    * WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
        * THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
